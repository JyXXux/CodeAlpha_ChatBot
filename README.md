# 🤖 Basic Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

A beginner-friendly **rule-based chatbot** built using Python. This project was developed as **Task 4 for the CodeAlpha Python Internship** and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts through an interactive command-line chatbot.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The chatbot interacts with users by responding to predefined inputs such as greetings and exit commands. It runs continuously until the user chooses to quit and logs the entire conversation for reference.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Case-insensitive and trimmed user input handling
* Time-based greetings (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)
* Help command to display available options
* User name memory during the session
* Chat history logging to a text file
* Emoji-supported responses (UTF-8 encoding)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Functions
* Loops (`while` loop)
* Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
* File handling with UTF-8 encoding
* Input and output operations
